                The hate on geese must stop! Geese are just normal birds that live their lives<br>
                based on instinct. They look very cute and their ducklings are very fluffy!<br>
                As long as you do not bother them, they will not bother you. Besides, we need<br>
                to be understanding that they have to migrate thousands of miles just to hibernate.<br>
                They just might be a little cranky.

            <p>
                Geese are evil incarnate! They attack unprompted and are incredibly selfish.<br>
                Their poops have plagued Canadian parks for years and has only been getting worse<br>
                through the years. They lay their nests in inconvenient places and force traffic to<br>
                stop for them. Their protection laws must be changed and we should be allowed <br>
                to kill them.
